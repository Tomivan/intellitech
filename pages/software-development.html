            <p>How we Deliver Software and Products</p>
            <p>Prior to beginning development, we first plan with our client. After<br /> 
                that, we brainstorm and share ideas with them. Of course, as a top<br /> 
                software development firm, we don't create a product and then<br /> 
                abandon our clients' businesses. We want to be linked with<br /> 
                outstanding goods.</p>
            <p> We take delivery times seriously because they are so important. We<br /> 
                respect both our own time and that of our clients. For these reasons,<br /> 
                we make sure to create a timeline following all of our planning.</p>
